# linear_regression
This is the code for linear regression using Numpy. I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied.
If there is a relationship between the two, we can prove it using [linear regression](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/250).
I used [Gradient Descent](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/06/24/gradient-descent-linear-regression/) algorithm for Linear regression.<br />
The code is in Python 3 and the only dependency is Numpy.<br />
Just run the code regression-demo.py and see the results.<br />
Check out the output.txt file to see the result of the code and how the error reduces.
